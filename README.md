 Predictive-Breast-Cancer-Diagnostic-Model

This model takes breast cancer data from the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Database in the form of features like concavity, texture, smoothness, and fractal dimension and predicts whether the cancerous tumor is benign or malignant. I did this project as part of an online course about applied machine learning with the University of Michigan.
